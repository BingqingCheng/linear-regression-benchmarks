-------------------

This contains the 7,211 molecules from the QM7b database and the 52 molecules from the AlphaML showcase dataset (including nucleobases, amino acids, simple sugars, drug molecules and C8 hydrocarbons) in extended-xyz format (as well as their corresponding output files), with the isotropic dipole polarizability, anisotropic dipole polarizability, 6 dipole polarizability components, (unrelaxed) dipole moments, (unrelaxed) traceless quadrupole moments, HF total energy, MP2 same-spin correlation energy, MP2 opposite-spin correlation energy, CCSD same-spin correlation energy, and CCSD opposite-spin correlation energy given in the header. All the properties were computed by linear response coupled cluster theory and d-aug-cc-pVDZ basis set with v1.1 of the Psi4 code. All the properties have units in au.
