7165 small molecules with their atomization energies (unit: kcal/mol)

QM7 is a subset of GDB-13 (a database of nearly 1 billion stable and synthetically accessible organic molecules) containing up to 7 heavy atoms C, N, O, and S. The 3D Cartesian coordinates of the most stable conformations and their atomization energies were determined using ab-initio density functional theory (PBE0/tier2 basis set).
