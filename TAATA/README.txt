Dataset: TAATA-2016 


This data set consists of total unit cell energies of a number of
crystal structures in the Ti-Zn-N, Zr-Zn-N, and Hf-Zn-N phase
diagrams. The energies were calculated using the PBE functional
using the VASP electronic structure code. The structures were created
by fully relaxing from starting states found in ICSD and COD, taking
symmetry-inequivalent entries matching the signature of two anions and
one cation.

The data set is from the paper:
Tholander, Andersson, Armiento, Tasn√°di, and Alling "Strong
piezoelectric response in stable TiZnN2, ZrZnN2, and HfZnN2 found by
ab initio high-throughput approach", J. Appl. Phys. 120, 225102 (2016).
(Please cite this paper when using the data.)

The data is in files on extended XYZ format. 

The target property is formation energy, which lies under "dft_formation_energy_in_eV"
